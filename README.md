- ⏳ I am 29 years old, and have been working around web development for 8 year.
- 🧳 I'm currently working as a full stack engineer. I write code, test it, integrate it, update it, deploy it, automate it, aaaand debug it.
- 💻 I am currently using PHP and Laravel for work, but also use VueJS in an [InertiaJS](https://inertiajs.com/) context.
- 🗺 I live in Lyon, France.

### Favorite technos

- 💻 Laravel in general, as an API or with an interface
- 🐳 Docker ❤️
- 🏷 VueJS, with a newfound love for composition API / `<script setup>`
- 🔗 GraphQL, that I'm still learning
- 🌃 Tailwindcss
- 📚 LaTeX, only because 10 years old tutorials still work perfectly as of today.

### Stuff I like

- ☕️ I like drinking latte while playing around new technos
- 🩳 I recently rediscovered how I love swimming
- 🇰🇷 I'm currently learning korean. It was at first as an hobby, now I'm enjoying it too much to stop anytome soon!
- 📺 I like loosing myself on the dev part of Youtube, watching tutorials about technos I don't think I'll use in my lifetime.
- 🕹 I like discovering game on the Game Pass then spending 100+ hours on them without realizing.

### Stuff I need to spend time on

- Everything about PaaS, Vercel, Heroku and so on
- JS technology such as Prisma, Typescript, React...
- Serverless technologies
- Did I say React?
- Svelte, SolidJS and other things presented by [Fireship.io](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAsM9c2sGjA&list=PL0vfts4VzfNiP4xgrtnSUbK99iXLINc9m) deserve their time too
- Maybe more testing frameworks (front and back end)
- Working out
- Kubernetes
- Finding emojis for this list
